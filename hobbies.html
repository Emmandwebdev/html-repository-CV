<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<p>I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged and excited, however I enjoy watching documentaries, as they offer deep insights into the realitie of life and I take a lof counsel from it. Playing volleyball is a sport I like, it's a fun way to stay active and connect with friends. Traveling is something I cherish, especially because it allows me to explore new cultures and try out different cuisines. Additionally, I love walking in nature, I get to think out loud HAHA!!!  It also provides a peaceful escape and a chance to appreciate the beauty I never thought about </p>
